# Web Development

This repository contains my **web development learning and practice**, covering both **frontend and backend concepts**.

I use this repo to:
- Learn web technologies step by step
- Practice concepts with small examples and mini-projects
- Build a strong foundation before moving to advanced frameworks

---

## What I’m Learning Here
- Frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Layouts, responsiveness, and UI components
- Backend basics and databases (as I progress)
- Full-stack concepts over time

---

## Structure
- Topic-wise folders for concepts
- Mini-projects to apply what I learn
- Clean, readable, and well-organized code

---

## Tools
- VS Code  
- Git & GitHub  

---

This repository will keep evolving as I grow as a web developer.
